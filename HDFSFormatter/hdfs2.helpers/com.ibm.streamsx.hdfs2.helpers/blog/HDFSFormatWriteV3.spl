/**
 * Convert a tuple to a string and then write to HDFS.
 * The operator converts input tuples on its input stream
 * to strings, and then sends them to the HDFS2FileSink.
 * It includes a default conversion using SPL's tuple
 * format, but allows you to supply a operator
 * to do the conversion from tuple to rstring.
 * 
 * We have added a default operator, so now, you can use it
 * with JSONToTuple, 
 * 
 *     () as sink = HDFSFormatWrite_V2(inStream) {
 *        param
 *        formatter:JSONToTuple;
 * 	  file: \"myfile.json\";
 *      }
 * 
 * But for the txt case, no operator is necessary.
 * 
 *     () as sink = HDFSFormatWrite_V2(inStream) {
 *         param
 *         file: \"myfile.txt\";
 *     }
 * 
 *  
 * @input inStream Stream to be written to HDFS
 * @param formatter (optional) operator to be used for converting from tuple to string
 * @param file File name to be passed on to HDFSFileSink
