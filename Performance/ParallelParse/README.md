# ParallelParse

Code repository for the StreamDev post: https://developer.ibm.com/streamsdev/docs/parallelized-file-processing-parse-operator/

To run the experiments, first create a directory named `data`. Then, run `makedata.py`, which will generate
a synthesized input file containing random numbers and strings. Finally, you can run all of the experiments by 
running `run.py`, which will compile, execute, and report the results in a file called `results.csv`.
